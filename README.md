In this, I have created an ML model for predicting winners of IPL 2023 matches.
First, I have done all preprocessing steps like handling null values, feature engineering, etc.
Then, I have done some visualizations like no. of toss decisions , no. of matches each team won, etc.
Then, I have made an ML model for winner prediction ( Random Forest Classifier is used).
Finally, I have done the tesing and accuracy comes to be 93.29%.
